# Financial support

You can directly support the project with a financial donation.
Donations from the Yogis are very important because they allow
us to keep the cost of joining the tour as low as possible.
All donations will be used to cover the tour expenses such as
accommodation, food, public programs etc. All leftover funds
(if any) will be donated to Sahaj schools.

## Non-financial support

There are many ways that you can support the project without making a
financial donation! Non-financial support from Yogis is just as important and
without it, such a project would not be possible.

- Join a route. We obviously need many Yogis to actually participate!
- Vibrational support and having the project in your attention.
- Help with renting a car or allowing the us to use your private car.
  Using yogis cars for the tour (and therefore avoiding car rental) is
  a massive logistical and financial help. But even referring affordable
  and reliable car rental companies is super valuable!
- Cooking! Eating out all the time is very expensive so we will try to avoid
  it as much as possible. For that, we need help from the local yogis in
  cooking and with food in general. Even providing a kitchen for the touring Yogis
  to cook and store food is a great help.
- Even if you cannot join any of the routes, please join the programs that are
  close to you. Or just be in the company of touring yogis. Being together is
  great fun!
- Promoting the programs that are in your local area. This can be word of mouth,
  distributing posters and advertising materials, etc.
- We need a lot of equipment including tents, sound system, etc.
  We will make an inventory system to keep track of the items that we need or have
  borrowed. Please get in touch if you can help this area!

  If the we borrow anything and damage it along the way,
  we will either replace it or pay for the damage.
