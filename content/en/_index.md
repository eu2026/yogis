Welcome to the Europe Tour Project! With this project, we hope to go beyond the arbitrary
borders of our individual nations and work together in bringing Sahaja Yoga and
spiritual awakening to the masses!

From Sahasrara Puja to Guru Puja, we will be traveling across Europe on five
routes, giving realization and spending joyful time with our brothers and
sisters!

It is also possible to partially join a route (one week for example).

**The deadline for registration is 1st of April.**

If you miss the deadline but still want to join the tour, we can be
flexible so do register! But please keep in mind that late registration
makes the planning and organizing more complicated so please register early!

After the registration deadline (1st of April), we will contact you over
WhatsApp with payment details, collect information about your arrival
and departure and will provide more specific information about your route.

If you change your mind and want to cancel your registration, please

we will automatically calculate the subsidized tour fee for you!

## About The Project

The desire of having a united Sahaj tour in Europe was inspired by
the Brazil and the Awaken Spirit tours (which went through the hosting
countries of Sahasrara Puja). EU practically has no borders, mostly
has the same currency, only a few languages, mostly the same timezone
and comparatively has a lot of Sahaj resources (ashrams, yogis etc.).
So why not do something similar to what yogis are already doing in Brazil, US etc.?
Why should we limit ourselves to the arbitrary borders of our country and
why not work together as one unit!? Independent yet united, hand in hand,
shoulder to shoulder, walking on the path of ascend!

The initial desires sounded nice but were not “solid” in the sense that they were
not yet anchored in reality. That quickly changed after many yogis heard about
the project around Shri Krishna Puja time! We saw that there is indeed a huge desire
for such a project and more importantly, it seems to be flowing.
The timing seems to be right. The initial enthusiasm was followed up by many
conversations and some effort. And things started to take shape!

The project structure is fairly simple. In our first meeting, we decided on a
primary route that starts in Cabella after Sahasrara Puja, goes to England
for Shri Adi Shakti Puja and comes back to Cabella for Guru Puja. With the primary
route established, we can start working with the local Yogis on the programs, logistics
and generally trying to understand their desires, needs, concerns,
capabilities, and capacities.

### Finances

We will use the Austrian Yuva bank account for collecting all donations, tour
fees and processing all the refunds and payments. This is a shared bank account
managed by 3 diligent Yogis (Lukas, Nandini and Sharmila) and has been used in many
Sahaj tours and projects in the past 2-3 years. The project organizers have no
access to this bank account.

The funds that are collected will be used for all the routes and will not be tied
to a specific region. This means that collectives with more Yogis and Sahaj resources
will end up supporting the smaller collectives. For example, in Germany we can mostly
stay with the Yogis and use Sahaj properties. This makes the German part cheaper
and we can use the money for the more expensive parts where the collectives are smaller
and need more financial support.

We are trying to be rather cost conscious and make the tours as affordable to
join as possible. This is only possible with generous support from the
Yogis! Whether it's direct financial support, offering food for touring yogis
or lending a car for a few days, it all adds up in making it more affordable
for everyone to join!

### Programs And Marketing

We will work with the local Yogis to understand what works
best for a given region. Realistically, like many other Sahaj tours, street realization
and music programs will play a big part. But we will try to explore all the possible
options. The other side of this is that, it takes a certain skill set or temperament
to do music program or street realization. Having different kinds of realization
programs allows Yogis with different characters and skills to get involved!
This makes the tour organization a bit more complicated but it's totally
worth it!

Marketing and advertisement highly depends on the type of program. A
music program with a bit of meditation probably will have a
different pitch than a standard public program. And a program in a
kindergarten or a busy park doesn't really need to be advertised at all.
It makes sense to share as much of the advertisement materials as possible,
but, we should always see if it makes sense for the given region.

As for our online presence, we will reuse existing local resources. This has the
immediate benefit of bringing traffic to existing websites, is less
effort on our side and involves the locals more. If the local yogis do not have
these resources (website, social mediate etc.), we will work together and
create these resources and hand them over to the locals after the tour. Additionally,
we will also create a simple website that introduces the project to the
seekers. This was requested by some of the collectives as it can help them
in getting venues.
