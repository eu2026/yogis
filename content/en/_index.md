This is the documentation website for the upcoming Euro tour project!
With this project, we hope to go beyond the arbitrary borders of our
individual nations and work together in bringing Sahaja Yoga and
spiritual awakening to the masses!

hosting or any other way?

## How Did It Start?

The desire of having a united Sahaj tour in Europe was inspired by
the Brazil and the Awaken Spirit tours (which went through the hosting
countries of Sahasrara Puja). EU practically has no borders, mostly
has the same currency, only a few languages, mostly the same timezone
and comparatively has a lot of Sahaj resources (ashrams, yogis etc.).
So why not do something similar to what yogis are already doing in Brazil, US etc.?
Why should we limit ourselves to the arbitrary borders of our country and
why not work together as one unit!? Independent yet united, hand in hand,
shoulder to shoulder, walking on the path of ascend!

The initial desires sounded nice but were not “solid” in the sense that they were
not yet anchored in reality. That quickly changed after many yogis heard about
the project around Shri Krishna Puja time! We saw that there is indeed a huge desire
for such a project and more importantly, it seems to be flowing.
The timing seems to be right. The initial enthusiasm was followed up by many
conversations and some effort. And things started to take shape!

## About The Project

The project structure is fairly simple. In our first meeting, we decided on a
primary route that starts in Cabella after Sahasrara Puja, goes to England
for Shri Adi Shakti Puja and comes back to Cabella for Guru Puja. With the primary
route established, we can start working with the local Yogis on the programs, logistics
and generally trying to understand their desires, needs, concerns,
capabilities, and capacities.

There are many countries and collectives that fall out of the primary route.
Those regions will be covered with independent parallel routes that, hopefully, will
at some point meet with the primary route!

### Finances

We will use the Austrian Yuva bank account for collecting all donations, tour
fees and processing all the refunds and payments. This is a shared bank account
managed by 3 diligent Yogis (Lukas, Nandini and Sharmila) and has been used in many
Sahaj tours and projects in the past 2 years. The project organizers have no
access to this bank account.

The funds that are collected will be used for all the routes and will not be tied
to a specific region. This is one of the more interesting aspects of the project.
The relatively poorer
countries such as Portugal, have fewer Yogis and fewer Sahaj
resources. This means that tour in these regions will be more expensive
(for example because there are no options for accommodation with the Yogis) and
harder for local Yogis to financially cover (fewer Yogis and lower income).
Comparatively, Austria or Germany are relatively wealthy countries with many
Yogis and Sahaj resources. This makes the tour in these regions cheaper
(because for example, we can potentially accommodate with the Yogis),
and local Yogis are more capable of fitting the bill (more yogis and better income).
In other words, smaller collectives in poorer countries are always at a financial
disadvantage. We hope to tackle this issue by sharing monetary resources!

We still have to figure out many details so stay tuned! We will regularly
update this website with the latest developments.

### Programs And Marketing

We will work with the local Yogis to understand what works
best for a given region. Realistically, like many other Sahaj tours, street realization
and music programs will play a big part. But we will try to explore all the possible
options. The other side of this is that, it takes a certain skill set or temperament
to do music program or street realization. Having different kinds of realization
programs allows Yogis with different characters and skills to get involved!
This makes the tour organization a bit more complicated but it's totally
worth it!

Marketing and advertisement highly depends on the type of program. A
music program with a bit of meditation probably will have a
different pitch than a standard public program! And a program in a
kindergarten or a busy park doesn't really need to be advertised at all!
It makes sense to share as much of the advertisement materials as possible,
but again, we should always see if it makes sense for the given region.

As for our online presence, Instead of creating new website and social media
outlets for the tour, we will reuse existing local resources. This has the
immediate benefit of bringing traffic to existing online resources, is less
effort on our side and involves the locals more! If the local yogis do not have
these resources (website, social mediate etc.), we will work together and
create these resources and hand them over to the local after the tour!

### The Team

Many yogis from many countries are involved in this project! The core team includes
Adel, Edita, Erwan, Mila, Piotr, Ram and many more!
