# Origins

The desire of having a united Sahaj tour in Europe was inspired by
the Brazil and the Awaken Spirit tours (which went through the hosting
countries of Sahasrara Puja). EU practically has no borders, mostly
has the same currency, only a few languages, mostly the same timezone
and comparatively has a lot of Sahaj resources (ashrams, yogis etc.).
So why not do something similar to what yogis are already doing in Brazil, US etc.?
Why should we limit ourselves to the arbitrary borders of our country and
why not work together as one unit!? Independent yet united, hand in hand,
shoulder to shoulder, walking on the path of ascend!

The initial desires sounded nice but were not “solid” in the sense that they were
not yet anchored in reality. That quickly changed after many yogis heard about
the project around Shri Krishna Puja time! We saw that there is indeed a huge desire
for such a project and more importantly, it seems to be flowing.
The timing seems to be right. The initial enthusiasm was followed up by regular
meetings and some effort. And things started to take shape!
