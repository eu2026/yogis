Passcode: `ikNy7z^g`

This was a big meeting with almost all representatives there! We had
the single goal of clarifying the routes and dates. I dare
say we managed!

The result of discussions is relfected in the [routes](../routes) page.

Besides the routes, some general questions came up which I'll try to
briefly explain here:

- Regarding the length of the tour, I personally prefer 3 weeks however
  sometimes that is not possible and dates spill over a bit. For many working
  professionals it is difficult to take 3 weeks of leave. Besides, longer tours
  tend to be more expensive and harder to manage. To balance things out a bit,
  we usually give people the option to join a part of the tour. In practice, this
  can be executed a few different ways. For example, you could allow yogis to join
  half the tour and pay half the amount. Or you could allow them to come at least
  for a week, meaning that Yogis can decide when and where to join. You could even
  put a daily price for the tour and allow Yogis to come for just a few days!
  The more flexibility we give to Yogis, the more Yogis can join, but it makes
  the organizing work harder. Also having people constantly rotating doesn't help
  with creating a group dynamic. We have to consider all of these things and
  come up with a solution that works for this project.
- Regarding transport, we will mostly rely on cars. Some touring Yogis will bring
  their own car to the tour, sometimes we can get cars from local Yogis and of course
  sometimes we have to rent cars. We will try to use Yogis' cars as much as possible
  to avoid dealing with car rental companies. But realistically we will most likely
  end up renting a few cars. We can also use public transport to fill the gaps.
  For example, if 2 or 3 people don't have a seat for just a day, they can potentially
  take a train or a bus to the next city.
- Regarding the number of attendees, I personally would cap it at max 30 people.
  This means that realistically at any given time, there will be around 20 to
  30 touring Yogis. If we see that a route is expensive or there is just not
  enough programs to require 30 people, we could consider reducing the limit.
  We could also go the other way and increase the limit but have to keep in
  mind that all touring Yogis need something meaningful to do. Also more people
  sometimes (but not always) makes the tour more expensive.
- Regarding the programs, touring Yogis can usually do any type of program. It is
  up to the local Yogis to see what program makes the most sense for them. For example,
  in your city, do you want to do a music program? A good old normal public program?
  Realization in the park? Or school? Etc. The end goal is to give realization and
  if possible, talk about Sahaja Yoga and point seekers to the local programs and
  local Yogis. Which is also why it's important to do the tour in areas where follow-up
  programs are possible. As discussed in the marketing meeting, we will not create
  dedicated social media outlets and websites for the tour. We will use whatever
  resources that local Yogis have and if needed, we will help them build up their
  local resources. We will try to make some content and re-use as much as possible
  but in the end, the advertising materials must make sense for the local programs.
  We will NOT have a centralized marketing approach simply because the
  project is too big! The approach of having the same marketing content for the whole
  tour works when there is a central theme for the seekers (i.e. inner peace, yoga,
  being in the moment etc.). For this project, coming with a single theme is neither
  practical nor necessary.

Passcode: `.Phzezc8`

This was the first meeting where we talked specifically about
marketing the tour - both to yogis and seekers.

The most important topic that got discussed was how to approach the seekers.
Should we have a unified front for the seekers under the same banner or not?
Considering that we are passing through many countries and can potentially
have many types of programs (from normal public programs to music programs,
to school programs etc.), we decided that it makes the most sense to use
the existing sahaj resources of each collective instead of creating new outlets.
What this means is that we will not create social media accounts or websites
for seekers to promote the tour and programs. Instead we will use the existing
websites and social media platforms that local yogis have and promote the programs
via those. This has the immediate benefit of bringing traffic to existing sahaj
portals. Also less effort for us and efforts will not be wasted after the tour
is finished!  We will still have to create various online and print advertising materials
so nothing changes there... These materials have to be made in a way that
makes sense for the region and type of program. If we can re-use a lot of designs
and wordings, great! If not, we have to do something a bit more customized.

- Durga will try make a video for the tour so that we can show in Diwali Puja weekend!
- Padmini will contact Cabella regarding our stay. It is likely that touring Yogis
  will stay a few days after Sahasrara Puja in Cabella and come a a few days before
  Guru Puja. So we need to ask permission for this.
- I will talk to UK people about the same topic... Coming earlier to Blossoms farm
  and leaving a few days after Shri Adi Shakti Puja.
- A few updates to be done on the yogis website to make the participating countries
  more visible/explicit
- Padmini can look into putting together the first drafts of a registration form
- Durga can support with online advertising of the programs

{{% details title="First Portugal specific meeting" closed="true" %}}
[link to recording](https://us06web.zoom.us/rec/share/XQ56tZQfvbE22YQ6U18BGv-Vx6T2-ivWR2UOXjZQpuA1L1LjYlYbk-666inIOoS8.A9csvGeK7UJCSB4h)
Passcode: `k?0eJCZ6`

This was the first meeting where we went a bit deeper into logistics of Portugal
specifically.

- We mostly focused on Lisbon and areas were we can do programs.
  There are few leads to follow but generally speaking, we need
  to look into venues and parks or open spaces where we can do program.
  Jardim da Estrela was a park candidate and nearby Casa do Jardim da Estrela
  could potentially be rented for a program
- Programs in parks and open spaces are good because we don't need to pay much
  (or at all). In venues, we have to pay for venue and advertisement but we do
  have people for longer and can work on them more. Look for smaller venues!
  Maybe up to 50 people. Open space programs and street realization can also
  be used for promoting the programs in the halls. It is perfectly fine to,
  for example, do a program in a park on a Sunday morning and Sunday
  evening go to hall and do another small program.  
- Other possibilities for doing programs are work places (meditation for stress
  reduction for example), schools, universities, etc. Realistically speaking,
  only local yogis can look into these and see if any opportunities come up
- As for accommodation, we do have to book something in Lisbon and/or Porto.
  Things would be simpler if we could somehow make a base camp between the
  two big cities in Leiria for example. But it seems just a bit too far...
- It seems like Sahaja Yoga Portugal does not have a website ... If the local
  yogis think this is useful, we could make one and hand it over to locals!
  We should also try to translate https://wemeditate.com/ to Portuguese for
  seekers!

{{% details title="Fourth general meeting" closed="true" %}}
This was the first meeting after announcing the tour in Cabella!
So there were many updates.

- The date for Sahasrara Puja is going to be 1st, 2nd and 3rd of May which
  means that we will most likely start on 6th of May from Cabella.
- Since Guru Purnima next year is on 26/07, most likely Guru Puja will be
  before that and will be the end of the tour.
- The presentation of the tour in Cabella was well received however it would've
  been nicer to have more time. Generally speaking we need to ramp up our
  communications with the local Yogis.
- As part of the communication with Yogis, we need to make this yogi's website
  a bit more colorful and nicer to look at.
- We had lots of discussions with the Portugal Yogis about programs, transport,
  and general practical matters. So it's safe to say that Portugal is progressing
  well! With the starting of the tour set, we know that we will be in Lisbon around
  27th of May. The first leg of the tour will conclude in Lisbon by the end of May.
  Second leg of the tour will start in Lisbon from beginning of June and for approximately
  a week we will do programs in Portugal. This highly depends on how many
  places we can visit there and how many programs we can arrange. So there is a
  chance that we will stay longer or shorter. We have now a
  dedicated WhatsApp group for Portugal so that others are not spammed.
  Lastly, it is possible to collaborate with Sopori in Lisbon and maybe even
  Madrid! We are looking in this opportunity.
- We will have a single registration form and there Yogis can choose which
  route they want to join.
- In terms of Yogis joining the tour, we should consider the amount
  flexibility that want to give to Yogis and how we want to communicate this.
  We could allow people to join and leave the tour on a daily basis but this
  makes organizing very difficult. Perhaps setting 2 weeks as the minimum
  duration of joining the tour makes sense. But we should communicate this
  clearly and mention that we can be flexible. We should pay attention to this
  in the registration form.
- We should try our best to keep out of dramas and politics of local collectives.
  We should keep in mind that we are just a band of Yogis going form place to
  place, giving realization, enjoying our brothers and sisters and going deeper
  together!
- As things are now, it is most important to bring local collectives on board
  and start fixing the routes.

{{% details title="Third general meeting" closed="true" %}}
This was not a single meeting but in fact many meetings that took
place over a few days...

- The routes are slowly taking shape and becoming more clear!
  - For the first half of the tour, we will go from Sahasrara Puja
    to Shri Adi Shakti Puja via France, Spain, Portugal, and Andorra.
    So nothing new here.
  - For the second half, we will most likely have multiple serial and parallel routes.
    One route will go from England to Frankfurt, then continue from Frankfurt to
    Cabella for Guru Puja. In parallel, possibly there will be routes from
    Finland or Estonia that will meet either in Cabella or Frankfurt.
  - The tour will start in Cabella with Sahasrara Puja and end in Cabella
    with Guru Puja!
- Most Yogis won't be able to join the whole tour so we need to provide the
  flexiblity to the Yogis so that they can join/leave when it is possible for them.
  This makes the planning and logistics a little more complicated but it is fairly
  common in all Sahaj tour that I've been involved in.
- In Germany, we can possibly use Marburg (near Frakfurt) as a "base" and
  stay there a few days. From there we can do day trips to nearby cities for programs.
  This makes it more reasonable to have Frakfurt/Marburg as a breakpoint.
- In Andorra, around the time that the tour will come, there is going to be a multi
  cultural festival which we can use! To take advantage of this we need to prepare
  some materials for seekers and put in an application. Local Yogis can help us here.
- Some progress has been made on the tour's presentation for Cabella
- As for the seeker-facing theme of the tour, we could potentially re-use the
  "in the moment" theme. We used that theme for Austria tours in the past years
  and the message seems to be fairly relevant to people. As a starting point,
  we can revive the old tour's website and get feedback from the Yogis.
- The Spanish Yogis also seem to be very keen for the tour and hopefully
  will soon get in touch directly!
- Mila will talk to the Italian Yogis regarding the start
  of the tour (since we will most likely have a stop in Italy)
- Eero can talk to Finnish and Estonian Yogis about a Nordic/Baltic route
- We still need to talk to French Yogis I think...

{{% details title="Second general meeting" closed="true" %}}

Due to my amazing internet, I missed parts of the meeting...

- This time had a slightly more diverse group of yogis in the call!
- We started by going through the first route (Milan to Lisbon)
  and talked about possible places where we can visit in Spain and south of France.
- We moved on to various practical aspects such as car rental,
  financial support etc. We didn’t go deep into these topics and
  mostly just skimmed through them.
- This time we spent a bit more time on the post Adi Shakti routes. It was clear
  that this part still needs more work and attention! Potentially we will have
  multiple parallel routes and end with Guru Puja.
- One of the first milestones will be presenting the tour to Shri Mataji
  and the collective. This could be done at the Navaratri Puja in Cabella.
  For this we need some preparation:
  - A decent idea of routes and dates
  - Local yogis should to some extent be on-board with the project
  - Have at least a presentation
  - A website with possibly a registration form
- In the coming days we can create work groups that focus on different
  aspects of the tour. For example, design/marketing/presentation, routes etc.
  One idea was to create separate groups for pre and post Shri Adi Shakti Puja
  routes so that Yogis can focus on their specific region. Figuring out the
  post Shri Adi Shakti Puja route is probably one of the most important
  things that we need to do in the next 2 weeks.

{{% details title="First general meeting" closed="true" %}}

- We started the meeting by going through a round of introductions.
  Most yogis were from Portugal so we decided to see what the tour means for them.
- We got a bit of a history of Sahaja Yoga in Portugal and what the
  current situation is. Takeaways are:
  - Sahaja Yoga has been around in Portugal since 1980.
  - It is difficult to establish a collective because Yogis often
    leave Portugal after some time.
  - Tourists can get realization which is nice but they don’t stay in the
    country either.
  - Lisbon, Leiria and Porto are places were we can do program.
  - It gets really hot in summer and to get locals, it’s best to
    have a tour in May or early June.
- Lisbon to Porto is traveling north and can nicely lead to visiting
  northern cities in Spain and later going to France and England but
  makes it hard to go to places like Madrid and Barcelona. To resolve
  this and make transport simpler, the idea came up to hire a bus
  from Milan and drive from Italy to Lisbon via southern France and
  central Spain. And then from Lisbon up north and eventually to England
  for Shri Adi Shakti Puja. Since there will be around 6 weeks between
  the two Pujas, we can nicely break into two legs of the tour. One
  leg from Milan to Lisbon and another from Lisbon to London. Lisbon
  can be the breakpoint where Yogis can rest and recover and leave/join the tour.
- For the plan to work, we need the cooperation of Spanish yogis who were not
  present on the call however we did manage to contact them and hopefully
  will be able to talk to them soon.
- With the bus in England, we will have 4-5 weeks until the next Puja in Cabella
  (Guru Puja) and so can drive down in Europe and continue the tour.
  This section was more hazy and will need more work to get clearer.
- After Guru Puja in Cabella, there was another idea to go up from Cabella to
  Helsinki and end the tour there. I feel like this also needs more polishing.
