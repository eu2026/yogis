# Meeting Notes

For both practical reasons and transparency, we will keep all the meeting notes here.

{{% details title="First general meeting" closed="true" %}}
- We started the meeting by going through a round of introductions.
  Most yogis were from Portugal so we decided to see what the tour means for them.
- We got a bit of a history of Sahaja Yoga in Portugal and what the
  current situation is. Takeaways are:
  - Sahaja Yoga has been around in Portugal since 1980.
  - It is difficult to establish a collective because Yogis often
    leave Portugal after some time.
  - Tourists can get realization which is nice but they don’t stay in the
    country either.
  - Lisbon, Leiria and Porto are places were we can do program.
  - It gets really hot in summer and to get locals, it’s best to
    have a tour in May or early June.
- Lisbon to Porto is traveling north and can nicely lead to visiting
  northern cities in Spain and later going to France and England but
  makes it hard to go to places like Madrid and Barcelona. To resolve
  this and make transport simpler, the idea came up to hire a bus
  from Milan and drive from Italy to Lisbon via southern France and
  central Spain. And then from Lisbon up north and eventually to England
  for Shri Adi Shakti Puja. Since there will be around 6 weeks between
  the two Pujas, we can nicely break into two legs of the tour. One
  leg from Milan to Lisbon and another from Lisbon to London. Lisbon
  can be the breakpoint where Yogis can rest and recover and leave/join the tour.
- For the plan to work, we need the cooperation of Spanish yogis who were not
  present on the call however we did manage to contact them and hopefully
  will be able to talk to them soon.
- With the bus in England, we will have 4-5 weeks until the next Puja in Cabella
  (Guru Puja) and so can drive down in Europe and continue the tour.
  This section was more hazy and will need more work to get clearer.
- After Guru Puja in Cabella, there was another idea to go up from Cabella to
  Helsinki and end the tour there. I feel like this also needs more polishing.

{{% details title="Second general meeting" closed="true" %}}
Due to my amazing internet, I missed parts of the meeting...

- This time had a slightly more diverse group of yogis in the call!
- We started by going through the first route (Milan to Lisbon)
  and talked about possible places where we can visit in Spain and south of France.
- We moved on to various practical aspects such as car rental,
  financial support etc. We didn’t go deep into these topics and
  mostly just skimmed through them.
- This time we spent a bit more time on the post Adi Shakti routes. It was clear
  that this part still needs more work and attention! Potentially we will have
  multiple parallel routes and end with Guru Puja.
- One of the first milestones will be presenting the tour to Shri Mataji
  and the collective. This could be done at the Navaratri Puja in Cabella.
  For this we need some preparation:
  - A decent idea of routes and dates
  - Local yogis should to some extent be on-board with the project
  - Have at least a presentation
  - A website with possibly a registration form
- In the coming days we can create work groups that focus on different
  aspects of the tour. For example, design/marketing/presentation, routes etc.
  One idea was to create separate groups for pre and post Shri Adi Shakti Puja
  routes so that Yogis can focus on their specific region. Figuring out the
  post Shri Adi Shakti Puja route is probably one of the most important
  things that we need to do in the next 2 weeks.

{{% details title="Third general meeting" closed="true" %}}
This was not a single meeting but in fact many meetings that took
place over a few days...

- The routes are slowly taking shape and becoming more clear!
  - For the first half of the tour, we will go from Sahasrara Puja
    to Shri Adi Shakti Puja via France, Spain, Portugal, and Andorra.
    So nothing new here.
  - For the second half, we will most likely have multiple serial and parallel routes.
    One route will go from England to Frankfurt, then continue from Frankfurt to
    Cabella for Guru Puja. In parallel, possibly there will be routes from
    Finland or Estonia that will meet either in Cabella or Frankfurt.
  - The tour will start in Cabella with Sahasrara Puja and end in Cabella
    with Guru Puja!
- Most Yogis won't be able to join the whole tour so we need to provide the
  flexiblity to the Yogis so that they can join/leave when it is possible for them.
  This makes the planning and logistics a little more complicated but it is fairly
  common in all Sahaj tour that I've been involved in.
- In Germany, we can possibly use Marburg (near Frakfurt) as a "base" and
  stay there a few days. From there we can do day trips to nearby cities for programs.
  This makes it more reasonable to have Frakfurt/Marburg as a breakpoint.
- In Andorra, around the time that the tour will come, there is going to be a multi
  cultural festival which we can use! To take advantage of this we need to prepare
  some materials for seekers and put in an application. Local Yogis can help us here.
- Some progress has been made on the tour's presentation for Cabella
- As for the seeker-facing theme of the tour, we could potentially re-use the
  "in the moment" theme. We used that theme for Austria tours in the past years
  and the message seems to be fairly relevant to people. As a starting point,
  we can revive the old tour's website and get feedback from the Yogis.
- The Spanish Yogis also seem to be very keen for the tour and hopefully
  will soon get in touch directly!
- Mila will talk to the Italian Yogis regarding the start
  of the tour (since we will most likely have a stop in Italy)
- Eero can talk to Finnish and Estonian Yogis about a Nordic/Baltic route
- We still need to talk to French Yogis I think...

{{% details title="Fourth general meeting" closed="true" %}}
This was the first meeting after announcing the tour in Cabella!
So there were many updates.

- The date for Sahasrara Puja is going to be 1st, 2nd and 3rd of May which
  means that we will most likely start on 6th of May from Cabella.
- Since Guru Purnima next year is on 26/07, most likely Guru Puja will be
  before that and will be the end of the tour.
- The presentation of the tour in Cabella was well received however it would've
  been nicer to have more time. Generally speaking we need to ramp up our
  communications with the local Yogis.
- As part of the communication with Yogis, we need to make this yogi's website
  a bit more colorful and nicer to look at.
- We had lots of discussions with the Portugal Yogis about programs, transport,
  and general practical matters. So it's safe to say that Portugal is progressing
  well! With the starting of the tour set, we know that we will be in Lisbon around
  27th of May. The first leg of the tour will conclude in Lisbon by the end of May.
  Second leg of the tour will start in Lisbon from beginning of June and for approximately
  a week we will do programs in Portugal. This highly depends on how many
  places we can visit there and how many programs we can arrange. So there is a
  chance that we will stay longer or shorter. We have now a
  dedicated WhatsApp group for Portugal so that others are not spammed.
  Lastly, it is possible to collaborate with Sopori in Lisbon and maybe even
  Madrid! We are looking in this opportunity.
- We will have a single registration form and there Yogis can choose which
  route they want to join.
- In terms of Yogis joining the tour, we should consider the amount
  flexibility that want to give to Yogis and how we want to communicate this.
  We could allow people to join and leave the tour on a daily basis but this
  makes organizing very difficult. Perhaps setting 2 weeks as the minimum
  duration of joining the tour makes sense. But we should communicate this
  clearly and mention that we can be flexible. We should pay attention to this
  in the registration form.
- We should try our best to keep out of dramas and politics of local collectives.
  We should keep in mind that we are just a band of Yogis going form place to
  place, giving realization, enjoying our brothers and sisters and going deeper
  together!
- As things are now, it is most important to bring local collectives on board
  and start fixing the routes.
