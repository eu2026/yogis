# Jai Shri Mataji {{< icon "heart" >}}

This is the documentation website for the upcoming Euro tour!
With this project, we hope to go beyond the arbitrary borders of our
individual nations and work together in bringing Sahaja Yoga and
spiritual awakening to the masses!

The tour is made up of multiple routes, each going for 2 to 3 weeks:

- Cabella to Lisbon - Starting after Sahasrara Puja
- Lisbon to Blossoms Farm - Ending with Shri Adi Shakti Puja
- Blossoms Farm to Frankfurt - After Shri Adi Shakti Puja
- Frankfurt to Cabella - Ending with Guru Puja

This goes for almost 2 months! Obviously we don't expect anyone to
be able to join the whole thing. Yogis have the flexibility of joining
and leaving the tour whenever it suites them.

  Please let the organizers know if you are joining the
  tour and your arrival/departure date has changed!
