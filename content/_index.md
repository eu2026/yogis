## Origins

The desire of having a united Sahaj tour in Europe was inspired by the Brazil and Awaken Spirit tours (which went through the hosting countries of Sahasrara Puja).
EU practically has no borders, mostly has the same currency, only a few languages, mostly the same time zone and comparatively, has a lot of Sahaj resources (ashrams, yogis etc.).
So why not do something similar to what yogis are already doing in Brazil, US etc.? Why should we limit ourselves to the arbitrary borders of our country and why work together as
one unit? Independent yet united, hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder, walking on the path of ascend!

The initial desires sounded nice but were not “solid” in the sense that they were not yet anchored in reality. That quickly changed after many yogis heard about the project around Shri Krishna Puja time! We saw that there is indeed a huge desire for such a project and more importantly, it seems to be flowing. The timing seems to be right.

And now the initial preparations are already underway! As we work together, things take shape and evolve organically. It seems like the project is organizing it self and we are simply coming along for a ride. It is indeed amazing to see how from a hazy dream, solid realities can emerge!

As it stands now, this project will entail multiple tours (or you could say routes) one after the other. Starting from after Sahasrara Puja in Cabella to Lisbon via south of France and central Spain. From Lisbon to Porto and north of Spain, all the way up to north of France and Shri Adi Shakti Puja in England! And from England back to Cabella for Adi Guru Puja.

It is early days and things will surely evolve as we move on.

The core theme of the project is unity and moving beyond arbitrary borders that divide us.
We are hoping to create many events that can bring our Sahaj family closer together and on an individual level, strengthen our depth
