- We started the meeting by going through a round of introductions.
  Most yogis were from Portugal so we decided to see what the tour means for them.
- We got a bit of a history of Sahaja Yoga in Portugal and what the
  current situation is. Takeaways are:
  - Sahaja Yoga has been around in Portugal since 1980.
  - It is difficult to establish a collective because Yogis often
    leave Portugal after some time.
  - Tourists can get realization which is nice but they don’t stay in the
    country either.
  - Lisbon, Leiria and Porto are places were we can do program.
  - It gets really hot in summer and to get locals, it’s best to
    have a tour in May or early June.
- Lisbon to Porto is traveling north and can nicely lead to visiting
  northern cities in Spain and later going to France and England but
  makes it hard to go to places like Madrid and Barcelona. To resolve
  this and make transport simpler, the idea came up to hire a bus
  from Milan and drive from Italy to Lisbon via southern France and
  central Spain. And then from Lisbon up north and eventually to England
  for Shri Adi Shakti Puja. Since there will be around 6 weeks between
  the two Pujas, we can nicely break into two legs of the tour. One
  leg from Milan to Lisbon and another from Lisbon to London. Lisbon
  can be the breakpoint where Yogis can rest and recover and leave/join the tour.
- For the plan to work, we need the cooperation of Spanish yogis who were not
  present on the call however we did manage to contact them and hopefully
  will be able to talk to them soon.
- With the bus in England, we will have 4-5 weeks until the next Puja in Cabella
  (Guru Puja) and so can drive down in Europe and continue the tour.
  This section was more hazy and will need more work to get clearer.
- After Guru Puja in Cabella, there was another idea to go up from Cabella to
  Helsinki and end the tour there. I feel like this also needs more polishing.
