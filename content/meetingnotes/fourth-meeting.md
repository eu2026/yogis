This was the first meeting after announcing the tour in Cabella!
So there were many updates.

- The date for Sahasrara Puja is going to be 1st, 2nd and 3rd of May which
  means that we will most likely start on 6th of May from Cabella.
- Since Guru Purnima next year is on 26/07, most likely Guru Puja will be
  before that and will be the end of the tour.
- The presentation of the tour in Cabella was well received however it would've
  been nicer to have more time. Generally speaking we need to ramp up our
  communications with the local Yogis.
- As part of the communication with Yogis, we need to make this yogi's website
  a bit more colorful and nicer to look at.
- We had lots of discussions with the Portugal Yogis about programs, transport,
  and general practical matters. So it's safe to say that Portugal is progressing
  well! With the starting of the tour set, we know that we will be in Lisbon around
  27th of May. The first leg of the tour will conclude in Lisbon by the end of May.
  Second leg of the tour will start in Lisbon from beginning of June and for approximately
  a week we will do programs in Portugal. This highly depends on how many
  places we can visit there and how many programs we can arrange. So there is a
  chance that we will stay longer or shorter. We have now a
  dedicated WhatsApp group for Portugal so that others are not spammed.
  Lastly, it is possible to collaborate with Sopori in Lisbon and maybe even
  Madrid! We are looking in this opportunity.
- We will have a single registration form and there Yogis can choose which
  route they want to join.
- In terms of Yogis joining the tour, we should consider the amount
  flexibility that want to give to Yogis and how we want to communicate this.
  We could allow people to join and leave the tour on a daily basis but this
  makes organizing very difficult. Perhaps setting 2 weeks as the minimum
  duration of joining the tour makes sense. But we should communicate this
  clearly and mention that we can be flexible. We should pay attention to this
  in the registration form.
- We should try our best to keep out of dramas and politics of local collectives.
  We should keep in mind that we are just a band of Yogis going form place to
  place, giving realization, enjoying our brothers and sisters and going deeper
  together!
- As things are now, it is most important to bring local collectives on board
  and start fixing the routes.
