Due to my amazing internet, I missed parts of the meeting...

- This time had a slightly more diverse group of yogis in the call!
- We started by going through the first route (Milan to Lisbon)
  and talked about possible places where we can visit in Spain and south of France.
- We moved on to various practical aspects such as car rental,
  financial support etc. We didnâ€™t go deep into these topics and
  mostly just skimmed through them.
- This time we spent a bit more time on the post Adi Shakti routes. It was clear
  that this part still needs more work and attention! Potentially we will have
  multiple parallel routes and end with Guru Puja.
- One of the first milestones will be presenting the tour to Shri Mataji
  and the collective. This could be done at the Navaratri Puja in Cabella.
  For this we need some preparation:
  - A decent idea of routes and dates
  - Local yogis should to some extent be on-board with the project
  - Have at least a presentation
  - A website with possibly a registration form
- In the coming days we can create work groups that focus on different
  aspects of the tour. For example, design/marketing/presentation, routes etc.
  One idea was to create separate groups for pre and post Shri Adi Shakti Puja
  routes so that Yogis can focus on their specific region. Figuring out the
  post Shri Adi Shakti Puja route is probably one of the most important
  things that we need to do in the next 2 weeks.
