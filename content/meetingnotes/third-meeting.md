This was not a single meeting but in fact many meetings that took
place over a few days...

- The routes are slowly taking shape and becoming more clear!
  - For the first half of the tour, we will go from Sahasrara Puja
    to Shri Adi Shakti Puja via France, Spain, Portugal, and Andorra.
    So nothing new here.
  - For the second half, we will most likely have multiple serial and parallel routes.
    One route will go from England to Frankfurt, then continue from Frankfurt to
    Cabella for Guru Puja. In parallel, possibly there will be routes from
    Finland or Estonia that will meet either in Cabella or Frankfurt.
  - The tour will start in Cabella with Sahasrara Puja and end in Cabella
    with Guru Puja!
- Most Yogis won't be able to join the whole tour so we need to provide the
  flexiblity to the Yogis so that they can join/leave when it is possible for them.
  This makes the planning and logistics a little more complicated but it is fairly
  common in all Sahaj tour that I've been involved in.
- In Germany, we can possibly use Marburg (near Frakfurt) as a "base" and
  stay there a few days. From there we can do day trips to nearby cities for programs.
  This makes it more reasonable to have Frakfurt/Marburg as a breakpoint.
- In Andorra, around the time that the tour will come, there is going to be a multi
  cultural festival which we can use! To take advantage of this we need to prepare
  some materials for seekers and put in an application. Local Yogis can help us here.
- Some progress has been made on the tour's presentation for Cabella
- As for the seeker-facing theme of the tour, we could potentially re-use the
  "in the moment" theme. We used that theme for Austria tours in the past years
  and the message seems to be fairly relevant to people. As a starting point,
  we can revive the old tour's website and get feedback from the Yogis.
- The Spanish Yogis also seem to be very keen for the tour and hopefully
  will soon get in touch directly!
- Mila will talk to the Italian Yogis regarding the start
  of the tour (since we will most likely have a stop in Italy)
- Eero can talk to Finnish and Estonian Yogis about a Nordic/Baltic route
- We still need to talk to French Yogis I think...
